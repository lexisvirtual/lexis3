## The TH Problem: Why It's Difficult for Brazilians

As a Brazilian learning English, you might have noticed that the TH sounds are particularly challenging. The two TH sounds, θ (theta) and ð (eth), don't exist in Portuguese, making it hard to pronounce them correctly. In this guide, we'll break down the TH sounds, provide practical tips, and offer exercises to help you improve your pronunciation.

## Understanding the TH Sounds

### The Voiceless TH (θ)

* Pronunciation: /θ/ (as in "this" or "thin")
* Description: A voiceless interdental fricative, produced by placing the tongue between the upper and lower teeth, with no vibration of the vocal cords.
* Example sentences:
	+ This is my book. ( /θɪs ɪs maɪ ˈbʊk/)
	+ Thin slices of pizza are my favorite. ( /θɪn ˈslaɪz ɒv ˈpɪtsə ər maɪ ˈfeɪvərɪt/)
* Tip: Pay attention to the position of your tongue and teeth when pronouncing the voiceless TH. Keep your tongue between your teeth, and make sure your teeth are not touching.

### The Voiced TH (ð)

* Pronunciation: /ð/ (as in "the" or "this")
* Description: A voiced interdental fricative, produced by placing the tongue between the upper and lower teeth, with vibration of the vocal cords.
* Example sentences:
	+ The sun is shining. ( /ðə ˈsʌn ɪz ˈʃaɪnɪŋ/)
	+ This is a beautiful day. ( /ðɪs ɪz ə ˈbjuːtɪfʊl deɪ/)
* Tip: Pay attention to the vibration of your vocal cords when pronouncing the voiced TH. You can feel it in the back of your throat.

## Tips for Pronouncing TH

### Practice with Audio

* Don't pronounce TH as a 's' or 'z' sound (e.g., "sis" instead of "this").
* Don't pronounce TH with a weak or lazy pronunciation (e.g., "thhhis" instead of "this").
